title: Mission Statement
description: INF-YT's aims and objectives
---

We at the [INF-YT](http://inf-yt.org.uk) want:

1. an API providing each student with access to all their data held
    by the university
2. access to open datasets from the university


In order to provide as much value as possible, both to the university
and its students, we believe that the university should provide open
access to as much information as possible.
We want to see course timetables, anonymised student data, and university
endowment information - all the data a fee-paying student and a
tax-paying public are entitled to receive from a publicly-funded
university.


Rationale
---------

Having a strong open-data supporting infrastructure can save the
University of Edinburgh money and effort. It:

* enables better data re-use across departments
* minimises [duplicated][ted] [effort][timetab]
* enables students to contribute to and gain real-world experience with
    APIs

By providing access to both APIs and open datasets, the University of
Edinburgh gains:

* prestige in the large open-data movement, placing it as a thought-leader
    along with Lincoln, Southampton, and Oxford
* students who are able to contribute to the running of their own education
    in a meaningful way, by building tools and using the infrastructure
    made available to them
* discipline in data - if departments are required to release and share
    their data, they have added impetus to keep good records

The Informatics Young-Team blog.


Setting up locally
------------------

This blog is static site, generated by [Hakyll][].

The site-generating-wotsit can be compiled from `site.hs`, which may
change - if `site.hs` ever *does* change, remove the `site` executable
and run the following commands to recompile everything:

```bash
ghc --make site.hs
./site rebuild
```

You can test the site locally by running `./site preview`.

There is a [tutorial about templates on the Hakyll site][templating].


Adding posts
------------

Posts are written in [Pandoc markdown][], and are placed in `posts/`
with a filename of `yyyy-mm-dd-post-slug`, where `yyyy-mm-dd` is the
date that you wrote the post in [ISO 8601][] format, and
the `post-slug` is ideally a human-shareable descriptive URL for your
post. The title of your post piped through `tr` as one possible option:

```bash
echo "MY AWESOME POST ON DATA FREEDOM!!!" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr '[:blank:]' '-' | tr --delete --complement '[:alnum:]
```

Each post is preceded by a 'metadata block', which *must* have both
a `title` and a `description` attribute:

```markdown
---
title: MY AWESOME POST ON DATA FREEDOM!!!
description: So yeah, we need more of that stuff, right?
---

MY AWESOME POST ON DATA FREEDOM!!!
==================================

(...)
```

After you've written a post, you can `git push` back up to GitHub, and
then `git push production` which sends it out onto [the WWW][inf-yt blog]!

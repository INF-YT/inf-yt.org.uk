[Ewan Klein][], representative for the [Open Knowledge Foundation in Scotland][OKFN Scotland],
and one of the people behind the hackathon where MyEd 2."oh" (and the INF-YT)
was created, has graciously invited us to do a lightning talk at
the [next OKFN Scotland meetup][meetup]. So in order to introduce ourselves to
the wider community engaged in opening up business and government data to
the public, we've accepted the invitation to be at the [May OKFN Scotland meetup][meetup]!

In our lightning talk ("From the Ground Up: enabling access to
educational data, one tool at a time") we'll be going over:

* MyEd 2."oh"
* why we started the INF-YT
* who we're working with in the University of Edinburgh
* the importance of working from the bottom-up
* current projects and future direction

So come see us at [TechCube][] on the 16th of May. The event is informal,
all talks are super-short, the people are friendly, and the talk list is
shaping up to be something to look forward to - plus, there's usually food!
Always a bonus :)

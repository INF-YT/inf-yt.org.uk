[Hi everybody][dr. nick]! We're the Informatics Young Team (or [INF-YT][] for
short) and we're a small team of students at the [University of Edinburgh][].
We formed during the uni's [Innovative Learning Week][ilw], on the first day
of the [Smart Data Hack][]. And at the end of the week we won the
[Best Data Mashup][] category for first years (sponsored by [CompSoc][]),
after building a
[prototype replacement to the university portal][myed 2."oh"],
and [we each walked away with a Nexus 7][#winning].

Now, a month-and-a-half later, we're being supported by [CompSoc][]
(to the tune of pizzas and server money!) as one of their Special Interest
Groups, we've written a [mission-statement][], and finished building
a [shiny new interface to the uni student timetable tool][inf-ytimetab].

The Smart Data Hack was a great event, giving many of us our first tastes
of working with datasets (both [public][aliss] and [private][skyscanner])
and finding cool applications for them. But, we thought, why were we
building cool tools for other organisations, when we haven't built any
for ourselves or other students at Edinburgh?

Going forward, we're speaking to [Ewan Klein][], who is the representative of
[the Open Knowledge Foundation][okfn] in Scotland, and is the main driving
force behind [efforts to open up data here at UoE][data.ed.ac.uk],
and we hope to have the support of both the [student union][EUSA]
and the [School of Informatics][] soon.

Our overarching goals are laid out in [our mission statement][mission-statement]
(which *will* change over time), but our main aim in the
Informatics Young Team will be selfish, to build tools to make *our*
lives (and incidentally those of others) at the university of Edinburgh
easier, tools which use data and information that already exists in
various departments and schools.


In one sense we're a grass-roots open-data movement.
We want the information, but we know that getting it all at once.
So we'll build all the little things we can, until one day we've built
something big. Fingers crossed.
